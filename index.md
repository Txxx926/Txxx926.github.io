## About Me

I am now a PhD candidate @[CUHK CSE](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Henry Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io/). Prior to this, I got my B.E from @[NWPU CS](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in July, 2022.

## Research Interests
  I am broadly interested in system design for Machine Learning (**<autocolor>MLSys</autocolor>**), including the following topics:
- **<autocolor>Resource Scheduling:</autocolor>** Maximize the allocation and utilization of available resources to accomodate workloads in the cluster.
- **<autocolor>ML Inference:</autocolor>** Design highly effective and scalable systems capable of efficiently serving a large volume of requests.
- **<autocolor>Distributed Training:</autocolor>** Develop and optimize strategies for efficient training of large models at scale.
